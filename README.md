# Interactive Quiz Made with JavaScript

## Description

This project is an outline for an interactive quiz. There is a timer, feedback on whether a question was answered correctly, and a high score feature.

This could be used as a shell for any quiz and easily updated with a new series of questions. It's a great assets for teachers who write their own quizzes.

The activity helped to teach me more about arrays, preventing time from running past 0, pulling specific elements from HTML, and hiding/showing specific portions of a page.
